                    You can't make homes out of humans.<br>
                    My life's not a fire to keep you warm<br>
                    My arms aren't walls to protect you,<br>
                    From your own internal storm,<br>
                    My heart is not a light switch,<br>
                    For you to turn on when you please,<br>
                    I can't carry the weight of your regret<br>
                    Because I'm buckling at the knees,<br>
                    My legs are a solid foundation,<br>
                    But they aren't yours on which to build,<br>
                    The holes in my heart can fit both of us,<br>
                    But you cannot decide how they're filled,<br>
                    You can't make homes out of humans,<br>
                    I won't let you in just because you have knocked,<br>
                    And if you keep using my heart as your doormat,<br>
                    The next time you'll find that it's locked.<br>
