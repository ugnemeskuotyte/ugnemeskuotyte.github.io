                    The thing about pain,<br>
                    Is it won't last forever,<br>
                    And it kills you right now,<br>
                    But with time it gets better,<br>
                    The thing about scars,<br>
                    Is they all start to fade,<br>
                    Until nothing is left,<br>
                    Of the cuts that were made,<br>
                    The thing about today,<br>
                    Is there's always tomorrow,<br>
                    And if you can't find your smile,<br>
                    I have one you can borrow,<br>
                    The thing about help,<br>
                    Is beside you it stands,<br>
                    But it won't know it's needed,<br>
                    Unless you reach out your hand,<br>
                    The thing about love,<br>
                    Is you can't feel it's touch,<br>
                    Until you let someone know,<br>
                    That this world is too much.<br>
